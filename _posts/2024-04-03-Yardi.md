title: Enriched Rooftop Data
---
Tim and the inside sales team had a spreadsheet list of rooftops in California. These lists had lots of information about the ownership, square footage, address, etc. We were tasked with enriching this data with more information so that inside sales could prioritize reach outs.

GIS team was presented with a .csv file containing information about thousands of rooftops in California. These rooftops were missing information that would help the inside sales team prioritize which rooftop owners to reach out to. The most important thing we need to do this is that the data must have latitude/longitude information if it isn't already in a spatial format. 

Fortunately this rooftop data did come with latitude and longitude columns and from this we were able to add in a number of new fields. These new fields provided a deeper insight to the quality of each rooftop by identifying whether they were in low income areas, BIA lands, fossil fuel/coal closure energy communities, or brownfields. Additionally we identified which utilities each rooftop fell within. Where available we also identified the circuit/substation name and voltage as well as estimated hosting capacity around each rooftop.
