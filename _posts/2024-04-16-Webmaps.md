GIS team can create interactive webmaps that have zoom, pop ups, address search, toggleable layers, a measure tool, and layer search. These can be created for situations where a static map or kmz files would be unwieldy.

GIS team has created a series of webmaps to display our signed pipeline against various tax credit layers. These maps also display utility territory, county information, alongside various basemap options. These are displayed on a state by state level and allow the user to see how many sites we have in a state as well as where those sites are. Additionally, there is further information about the site stored as pop ups. If you click on a site more information will appear. These webmaps are updated around the 1st and 15th of each month. Beside the "Signed Parcels" layer will be the date of the last update.

The webmaps can be publically or privately accessed depending on what is appropriate. The ones for our signed leases (linked below) are private maps so a sign in must be requested from GIS team.
