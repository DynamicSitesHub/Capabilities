This is a template for a GIS task post. This initial paragraph should contain a brief summary of what exactly the task is so that it appears on the blog home page


To have a second paragraph i think you do this, must have two lines in between. Try to keep further thoughts on this page so that it doesn't appear in the excerpt.


I also advise using source code mode, will help you see the formatting better
